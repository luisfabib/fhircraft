    Fhircraft is a Python package that dynamically generates Pydantic FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) resource models from FHIR specifications, enabling comprehensive data structuring, validation, and typing within Python. It also offers a fully functional FHIRPath engine and code generation features to facilitate integration with other systems.

!!! important "Active development"

    This package is under active development. Major and/or breaking changes are to be expected in future updates.


## Why use Fhircraft?

- **Dynamic FHIR models** – Generate Pydantic FHIR resource models dynamically from FHIR specification; get all FHIR's data structuring, validation and typing in a pythonic way.

- **Simple FHIR validation** – Perform complete parsing and validation of FHIR resources without leaving Python; avoid dealing with FHIR's often complex rules and constraints. 

- **Pydantic core** – Profit from Pydantic's validation and (de)-serialization capabilities which have made it the most widely used data validation library for Python.     

- **Code generator** – Leverage the code generation features of Fhircraft to write static Pydantic/Python code that can be integrated into other systems. 

- **Pythonic FHIRPath** – Fhircraft provides a fully functional, pythonic and compliant FHIRPath engine to easily work with FHIR resources without leaving Python.
